Subject: URGENT bug fixing


Dear [newly hired junior team member],

it's me, James, from the dev team. I'm still on vacation at the World Cup, but
our boss asked me to look at in important issue in the codebase ASAP.

I need you to send me some of the source files from the live server so I can
look for the bug.

But since I'm on vacation and I can only use the hotel's computer, we need to
do this encrypted, it's our policy, and send the data and passwords in separate
channels. (I'm sending you a small shell script that will make it easy.)

Just run it like this, these are the files I need:

	./encrypt-multi.sh /var/www/index.php /var/www/admin.php /var/www/db.inc /var/www/upload.php

It will generate a bunch of `.enc` files in the current dir, and print out a
list of secure, machine-generated passwords it encrypted them with.

1) Send me the `*.enc` files to my private email (just reply to this email) so
I can get them via webmail.

2) Send the passwords on a different channel, send them to me via the company
Slack or to my phone number. I can read it but can't receive files to my iPhone.

Thanks for doing this fast for all of us, it's very critical!

James
