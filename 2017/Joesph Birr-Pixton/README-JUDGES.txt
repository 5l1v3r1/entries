EVP_VerifyFinal
---------------

In the theme of Deceptive APIs, I submit for your consideration
the design of the OpenSSL function `EVP_VerifyFinal`.

Obviously this isn't in the true spirit of the UCC, and I'm
*not* suggesting genuine underhandedness on the part of the
OpenSSL project.  Please take this submission with a healthy
dose of sarcasm!

Files included:

- submission/EVP_PKEY_verify.pod: the documentation from the
  OpenSSL source tree.
- submission/README.md: main submission -- describing the
  problem and typical usage.
- LICENSE.txt: license details for all included files.
- AUTHORS.txt: attribution.
